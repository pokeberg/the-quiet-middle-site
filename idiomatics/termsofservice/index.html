      <div class="subtitle">Terms of Service</div>
    </header>

    <p>
      Idiomatics is a language game designed to be calm, playful, and respectful
      of your time. By downloading or using the app, you agree to the terms below.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Access & Purchase</h2>
    <p>
      Idiomatics is a one-time paid app. Your purchase grants access to the app
      as it is provided at the time of download. There are no subscriptions or
      in-app purchases.
    </p>

    <h2>Future Features</h2>
    <p>
      Some features may be marked as “coming soon”, such as Daily challenges or
      additional game modes. These features are planned, but not guaranteed to
      be released by a specific date — or at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      The app may change over time as features are added, modified, or refined.
    </p>

    <h2>Gameplay & Progress</h2>
    <p>
      Game progress, scores, and preferences are stored locally on your device.
      If Game Center is enabled, scores may be submitted to Apple’s Game Center
      services according to Apple’s own terms and policies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Leaderboards and scores are provided for fun only. Accuracy or permanence
      of data is not guaranteed.
    </p>

    <h2>Availability</h2>
    <p>
      Idiomatics is provided “as is”. While care is taken to keep the app stable
      and enjoyable, uninterrupted availability or future compatibility with
      all devices and operating systems cannot be guaranteed.
    </p>

    <h2>Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the fullest extent permitted by law, the developer is not liable for
      any damages, losses, or dissatisfaction arising from the use of the app.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
      These terms may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be made
      available at this URL.
